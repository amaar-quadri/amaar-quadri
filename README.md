# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm experienced with SolidWorks (CSWP), Finite Element Analysis, and GD&T. I also have extensive programming experience in various languages including Python, Java, and C++. I have a passion for using all of my skills for designing mechanical devices from the ground up!
